Python project featuring the modern and extensible Python project manager hatch.

## Development

After having cloned this repository:

1. install [hatch] globally with [pipx], i.e. `pipx install hatch`,
2. \[only once\] install `pre-commit` globall with `pipx install pre-commit`
3. \[only once\] run `pre-commit install` to install [pre-commit],

and then you are already set up to start hacking.

A special feature that makes hatch very different from other familiar tools is that you almost never
activate, or enter, an environment. Instead, you use `hatch run env_name:command` and the `default` environment
is assumed for a command if there is no colon found. Thus you must always define your environment in a declarative
way and hatch makes sure that the environment reflects your declaration by updating it whenever you issue
a `hatch run ...`. This helps with reproducability and avoids forgetting to specify dependencies since the
hatch workflow is to specify everything directly in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml). Only in rare cases, you
will use `hatch shell` to enter the `default` environment, which is similar to what you may know from other tools.

To get you started, use `hatch run cov` or `hatch run no-cov` to run the unitest with or without coverage reports,
respectively. Use `hatch run lint:all` to run all kinds of typing and linting checks. Try to automatically fix linting
problems with `hatch run lint:fix` and use `hatch run docs:serve` to build and serve your documentation.
You can also easily define your own environments and commands. Check out the environment setup of hatch
in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) for more commands as well as the package, build and tool configuration.
